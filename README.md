El Real Insituto y Observatorio de la Armada (ROA) is officially in charge of SI second realization, time keeping and dissemination in Spain. 
In our road to the consecution of an optical atomic clock, we have developed this tool that might be of interest for the scientific community.
This tool we named DOZE – Design & Optimization for Zeeman slower España and allows to run a series of calculations regarding slowing atomic beams by using Zeeman effect with permanent magnets.

DOZE uses cylinder-shaped permanent magnets to create transversal magnetic field. DOZE main functions are:
 - Calculates the needed magnetic field to slow 87Sr or 171Yb atoms under certain parameters (laser power and detuning, capture and final velocities...)
 - Let the user play around with magnets positions to check if the magnetic field generated matches with the needed one.
 - Allows automatic position of magnets to create a magnetic field as similar as possible to the needed one.
 - Runs calculations to check atomic kinetics along the slower.
 - Showe graphics related to previous calculations.
 - Saves simulation graphics and data in H5 format to have them available for later consultation in a dated folder.
 - Allows loading data from previous saved data to take over the analysis user was making.

We encourage interested user in reading the user manual, to see how the tool is conceived, how to use it and what to expect from it.
